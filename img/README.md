# Image Experiments
This directory contains images for experimentation with the Huffman coding file compressor "huff".

- 16x16 16-bit RGB image with only a single colour
- 16x16 16-bit RGB images containing only two colours (in precisely equal amounts) in various patterns
- 16x16 16-bit RGB images containing only four colours (in precisely equal amounts) in various patterns
- 16x16 16-bit RGB image with a random (Gaussian) noise filter
- 256x256 16-bit RGB image with only a single colour
- 256x256 16-bit RGB images containing only two colours (in precisely equal amounts) in various patterns
- 256x256 16-bit RGB images containing only four colours (in precisely equal amounts) in various patterns
- 256x256 16-bit RGB image with a random (Gaussian) noise filter
- images of varying dithering levels (Riemersma dithering) `dithering_<number of dithering levels per channel>_boats.bmp`. More levels means better quality.
